# Question 4

Industrial engineers periodically conduct “work measurement” analyses to determine the time required to produce a single unit of output. At a large processing plant, the number of total worker-hours required per day to perform a certain task was recorded for 50 days. The data are shown below:
128 119 95 97 124 128 142 98 108 120
113 109 124 132 97 138 133 136 120 112
146 128 103 135 114 109 100 111 131 113
124 131 133 131 88 118 116 98 112 138
100 112 11 150 117 122 97 116 92 122

## Part (a)

Compute the mean, median, and the mode of the data set.

```python {"id":"01HX5CPP13PMC8268MNAEYNFB2"}
import numpy as np
import scipy.stats as stats

worker_hours = [
    128, 119, 95, 97, 124, 128, 142, 98, 108, 120,
    113, 109, 124, 132, 97, 138, 133, 136, 120, 112,
    146, 128, 103, 135, 114, 109, 100, 111, 131, 113,
    124, 131, 133, 131, 88, 118, 116, 98, 112, 138,
    100, 112, 11, 150, 117, 122, 97, 116, 92, 122
]

mean = np.mean(worker_hours)
median = np.median(worker_hours)
mode = stats.mode(worker_hours)

print(f"Mean: {mean}")
print(f"Median: {median}")
print(f"Mode: {mode}")
```

Results:
Mean: 115.82
Median: 117.5
Mode: ModeResult(mode=97, count=3)

## Part (b)

Find the range, variance, and standard deviation of the data set.

```python {"id":"01HX5CPP13PMC8268MNE23DR9Y"}
range_ = np.ptp(worker_hours)
variance = np.var(worker_hours)
std_dev = np.std(worker_hours)

print(f"Range: {range_}")
print(f"Variance: {variance}")
print(f"Standard Deviation: {std_dev}")
```

Results:
Range: 139
Variance: 444.10760000000005
Standard Deviation: 21.073860586043555

## Part (c)

Construct the intervals ± s, ± 2s, and ± 3s. Count the number of observations that fall within each interval and find the corresponding proportions. Do you detect any outliers?

```python {"id":"01HX5CPP13PMC8268MNGXD2CWM"}
s = std_dev
s_2 = 2 * std_dev
s_3 = 3 * std_dev

intervals = [s, s_2, s_3]
intervals_data = []

for interval in intervals:
    data = [x for x in worker_hours if mean - interval <= x <= mean + interval]
    intervals_data.append(data)

for i, data in enumerate(intervals_data):
    print(f"Number of observations within ± {i + 1}s: {len(data)}")
    print(f"Proportion of observations within ± {i + 1}s: {len(data) / len(worker_hours)}")
```

Results:
Number of observations within ± 1s: 42
Proportion of observations within ± 1s: 0.84
Number of observations within ± 2s: 49
Proportion of observations within ± 2s: 0.98
Number of observations within ± 3s: 49
Proportion of observations within ± 3s: 0.98

## Part (d)

Construct a box plot for the data. Do you detect any outliers?

```python {"id":"01HX5CPP13PMC8268MNH4GPZAB"}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.boxplot(worker_hours)
plt.title("Box Plot of Worker Hours")
plt.show()
```

## Part (e)

Find the 70th percentile for the data on total daily worker-hours.

```python {"id":"01HX5CPP13PMC8268MNJCJPNNJ"}
percentile_70 = np.percentile(worker_hours, 70)
print(f"70th Percentile: {percentile_70}")
```

Results:
70th Percentile: 128.0
