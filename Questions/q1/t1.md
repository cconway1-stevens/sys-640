# Linear Programming Model

## Part (a)

### Decision Variables:
Let $$x_{ij}$$ be the number of units shipped from plant $$i$$ to destination $$j$$.
Let $$y_i$$ be a binary variable where $$y_i = 1$$ if plant $$i$$ is built and $$y_i = 0$$ otherwise, for $$i$$ in {Detroit, Toledo, Denver, Kansas City, St. Louis}.

### Objective Function:
Minimize the total cost which includes the shipping costs and the fixed costs of constructing the plants:
$$
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{i,j} c_{ij} x_{ij} + 175,000 \cdot y_{\text{Detroit}} + 300,000 \cdot y_{\text{Toledo}} + 375,000 \cdot y_{\text{Denver}} + 500,000 \cdot y_{\text{Kansas City}} + 0 \cdot y_{\text{St. Louis}}
$$
where $$c_{ij}$$ represents the shipping cost per unit from plant $$i$$ to destination $$j$$.

### Constraints:
1. Supply constraints:
$$
\sum_j x_{ij} \leq \text{Capacity}_i \cdot y_i \quad \forall i
$$
2. Demand constraints:
$$
\sum_i x_{ij} = \text{Demand}_j \quad \forall j
$$
3. Binary constraints:
$$
y_i \in \{0, 1\} \quad \forall i

## Part (b)

### Inclusion of Plant Location Policy
Add a constraint to ensure that either Detroit or Toledo, but not both, must have a plant:
$$
y_{\text{Detroit}} + y_{\text{Toledo}} = 1
$$

## Part (c)

### Restriction on Number of Plants
Include a constraint that limits the total number of plants among Denver, Kansas City, and St. Louis to at most two:
$$
y_{\text{Denver}} + y_{\text{Kansas City}} + y_{\text{St. Louis}} \leq 2
$$

## Part (d)

### Multiple Sizes for Denver Plant
Modify the decision variables and constraints to account for two possible sizes of the Denver plant:
Introduce a new binary variable $$z$$ where $$z = 1$$ if the larger size of the Denver plant is built, otherwise $$z = 0$$.
Adjust the capacity and fixed cost for Denver in the objective function and constraints.

Capacity Denver = $$30,000 \cdot y_{\text{Denver}} + 30,000 \cdot z$$
Fixed Cost for Denver = $$375,000 \cdot y_{\text{Denver}} + 175,000 \cdot z$$
Include a constraint to ensure that both sizes cannot be built simultaneously:
$$
y_{\text{Denver}} + z \leq 1
$$

Each part modifies the basic model to include specific business rules and policies. Issues that may arise include the complexity of managing multiple binary variables and ensuring that all constraints are correctly formulated to reflect the real-world limitations and strategies. The models provided here should guide decision-making regarding plant construction and distribution optimization.
