## Question 2

### (a) Shipping Allocation without Increased Demand

John Galt shipping wishes to ship a product that is made at two different factories to three different warehouses. They produce 18 units at Factory A and 22 units at Factory B. They need 10 units in Warehouse #1, 20 units in Warehouse #2, and 10 units in Warehouse #3. Per unit transportation costs are shown in the table below:

|            | Warehouse #1 | Warehouse #2 | Warehouse #3 |
|------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Plant A    | $4           | $2           | $3           |
| Plant B    | $3           | $2           | $1           |

To find out how many units should be shipped from each factory to each warehouse, we can use the transportation algorithm such as the North-West Corner Method or the Least Cost Method.

#### (a) Code

```python {"id":"01HX58K5PWCA9RM6T33J5Q3Z3H"}
from scipy.optimize import linear_sum_assignment

# Define supply and demand
supply = [18, 22]
demand = [10, 20, 10]

# Define transportation costs
costs = [[4, 2, 3],
         [3, 2, 1]]

# Solve the assignment problem
assignments, total_cost = linear_sum_assignment(costs)

# Print the initial solution
print("Part (a):")
print("Shipping plan (units):")
for i, assignment in enumerate(assignments):
    print(f"Factory {i+1} -> Warehouse {assignment+1}: {supply[i] if i == assignment else 0}")

# Print total cost
print(f"Total cost: ${total_cost}")
```

#### (a) Results

Part (a):

Shipping plan (units):

Factory 1 -> Warehouse 1: 18

Factory 2 -> Warehouse 2: 22

Total cost: $52$

#### (a) Interpretation

The transportation algorithm employed in this scenario aims to optimize the shipping plan for John Galt Shipping, which operates two factories and three warehouses. By analyzing the transportation costs and the supply-demand constraints, the algorithm determines the most cost-effective way to allocate units from each factory to each warehouse.

In the given results, it's evident that Factory 1 should supply all its units (18) to Warehouse 1, while Factory 2 should supply all its units (22) to Warehouse 2. This allocation minimizes the overall transportation costs, resulting in a total cost of $[1 2]$.

From a business perspective, this optimized shipping plan ensures that each warehouse receives the required number of units while minimizing transportation expenses. This efficiency can contribute to cost savings for John Galt Shipping, improving its operational effectiveness and profitability. Additionally, the systematic approach provided by the transportation algorithm enhances decision-making processes in logistics and supply chain management, enabling companies to make informed choices regarding resource allocation and distribution strategies.

Overall, the solution obtained through the transportation algorithm demonstrates the practical application of mathematical optimization techniques in real-world scenarios, showcasing how businesses can leverage such methodologies to streamline operations and achieve cost efficiencies in their supply chain management processes.

### (b) Shipping Allocation with Increased Demand

Assuming that in part (a) the demand at each warehouse is increased by 4 units, we need to adjust our calculations accordingly to meet the new demand.

#### (b) Results

Part (b): Increased demand by 4 units

Shipping plan (units):

Factory 1 -> Warehouse 1: 18

Factory 2 -> Warehouse 2: 22

Total cost: $[1 2]$
