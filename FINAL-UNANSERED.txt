1. The Martin-Beck Company is in the process of planning for new production facilities and developing a more efficient distribution system design. At present they have one plant at St. Louis with a capacity of 30,000 units. But because of increased demand, management is considering four potential new plant sites: Detroit, Denver, Toledo and Kansas City. The transportation table below summarizes the projected plant capacities, the cost per unit of shipping from each plant to each destination, and the demand forecasts over a 1 year planning horizon.
   
    |         | Boston | Atlanta | Houston | Capacities |
    |---------|--------|---------|---------|------------|
    | Detroit | 5      | 2       | 3       | 10,000     |
    | Toledo  | 4      | 3       | 4       | 20,000     |
    | Denver  | 9      | 7       | 5       | 30,000     |
    | Kansas City | 10  | 4       | 2       | 40,000     |
    | St.Louis | 8    | 4       | 3       | 30,000     |
    | Demand  | 30,000| 20,000  | 20,000  |            |
   
   Suppose that fixed costs of construction the new plants are:
   - Detroit: $175,000
   - Toledo: $300,000
   - Denver: $375,000
   - Kansas City: $500,000

   The Martin-Beck Company would like to minimize the total cost of plant construction and distribution of goods.
   a) Develop (but do not solve) a linear programming model of this problem
   b) Modify your formulation in part a) to account for the policy restriction that one plant but not both must be located in Detroit or in Toledo.
   c) Modify your formulation in part a) to account for the policy restriction that at most two plants can be located in Denver, Kansas City, and St. Louis
   d) Suppose that there are two possible sizes for the Denver plant, the one mentioned earlier with a capacity of 30,000 and a cost of $375,000, and another with a capacity of 60,000 and a cost of 550,000. Modify your formulation in part a) to account for this.
   
   In each case, discuss your formulations, and any issues that arise.

2. (a) John Galt shipping wishes to ship a product that is made at two different factories to three different warehouses. They produce 18 units at Factory A and 22 units at Factory B. They need 10 units in warehouse #1, 20 units in warehouse #2, and 10 units in warehouse #3. Per unit transportation costs are shown in the table below.
   
   |          | Warehouse #1 | Warehouse #2 | Warehouse #3 |
   |----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
   | Plant A  | $4           | $2           | $3           |
   | Plant B  | $3           | $2           | $1           |

   How many units should be shipped from each factory to each warehouse?
   (b) Assume that in part (a) the demand at each warehouse is increased by 4 units. Now how many units should be shipped from each factory to each warehouse?

3. In class we talked about interactive books and training manuals. Do you have any familiarity with any such electronic documentation? If so, critically evaluate it. If not, critically evaluate another piece of technical documentation you are familiar with (e.g., have used, or have helped to develop).

4. Industrial engineers periodically conduct “work measurement” analyses to determine the time required to produce a single unit of output. At a large processing plant, the number of total worker-hours required per day to perform a certain task was recorded for 50 days. The data are shown below:
   
   ```
   128 119 95  97  124 128 142 98  108 120
   113 109 124 132 97  138 133 136 120 112
   146 128 103 135 114 109 100 111 131 113
   124 131 133 131 88  118 116 98  112 138
   100 112 11  150 117 122 97  116 92  122
   ```

   (a) Compute the mean, median, and the mode of the data set.
   (b) Find the range, variance, and standard deviation of the data set.
   (c) Construct the intervals ± s, ± 2s, and ± 3s. Count the number of observations that fall within each interval and find the corresponding proportions. Do you detect any outliers?
   (d) Construct a box plot for the data. Do you detect any outliers?
   (e) Find the 70th percentile for the data on total daily worker-hours. Interpret its value.

5. A grain cooperative with warehouses in Lincoln, Des Moines, and Pierre must meet market demands in Denver, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and St Louis. The following table summarizes data relevant to this week’s distribution problem. The numbers in the first three rows and the first four columns are the transportation costs per unit from each warehouse to each market.
   
   | From/To    | Denver | Kansas City | Minneapolis | St Louis | Supply |
   |------------|--------|-------------|-------------|----------|--------|
   | Lincoln    | 6      | 4           | 8           | 9        | 750    |
   | Des Moines | 9      | 3           | 5           | 6        | 750    |
   | Pierre     | 9      | 11          | 6           | 14       | 500    |
   | Demand     | 400    | 700         | 400         | 500      |        |

   (a) Construct a network representation of the problem of minimizing total transportation costs associated with shipping product from the warehouses to meet market demand.
   (b) Formulate a LP model to solve this problem
   (c) Suppose that the cooperative also has a warehouse in Omaha with a supply of 500 units and transportation costs to Denver, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and St Louis of 6, 5, 7, and 9 respectively. Extend the LP formulation of (b) to include this option.
   (d) Explain why the cost of meeting demand in part (c) cannot exceed the cost of meeting demand in (b).
   (e) Solve the model given in part (c) using a spreadsheet optimization package, or by hand, as appropriate.
